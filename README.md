# Warplanes
It is like the classic warships game, just with warplanes. 

--------------

**Features:**
- The game is composed of two phases: placement and battle.
- A really simple game with simple graphics.
- It is in early development, but it already contains the basic elements.
- Positioning of the airplanes.
- Overlap detection.
- Airplane removal. It can be done by placing the head of the new airplane on top of the head of the need to be removed airplane and pressing the placement arrow. This will delete the old airplane without placing the new one.
- Basic AI functionalities: the computer is able to place its own airplanes.
- Basic battle system: the player is able to attack the AI, but AI counterattack is not yet implemented.
- Basic winning condition: if the head of all 5 airplanes are shot the player wins, resulting in the disappearance of the targeting cursor.


**Known bugs:**
- If an airplane is removed during the placement phase, it cannot be placed again. This result in one less airplane for the player.
